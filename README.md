# VideoPlace

-This Java-based project is a video rental system designed to help manage customer transactions and create invoices for a fictional video rental store called "VIDEO PLACE LEVITTOWN." The system allows employees to easily generate invoices by entering customer details, rental video information (such as quantity, description, and price), and payment methods (credit or cash). It automatically calculates subtotals and totals, validates the inputs, and generates an invoice in a .doc file format. The user interface is built using Java Swing, featuring input dialogs and image icons to create a more polished and professional experience. This project offers a basic foundation for a video rental system, with room for future improvements like integrating a database and enhancing the user interface.
